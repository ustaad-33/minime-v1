# minime-v1
This is an attempt to create a Text To Speech software trained on my voice which is able to replicate my exact voice, tones, speech structuring and is the first step in my initiative to create a digital clone of myself. The current data/info/code/etc etc corresponds to the first prototype of this project. Project Mini-Me
